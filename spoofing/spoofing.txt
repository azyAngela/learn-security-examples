Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Ans:
 Vulnerability refers to a weakness in the design, implementation, or configuration of a 
 software system that could be exploited by attackers to compromise the confidentiality, 
 integrity, or availability of the system or its data. Vulnerabilities can arise from various 
 sources, including programming errors, misconfigurations, design flaws, or improper handling of user input.
 The secure version didn't hard code the secret, and set sameSite to true, these kind of modifications will 
 ensure only authenticated user can access.

 CIA principle violated is the Confidentiality. The program didn't ensure that only authenticated user 
 can access the information.
