Confidentiality and integrity are violated. 

In the insecure version, the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authentication 
and authorization mechanisms when updating user roles. In the secure version, session-based 
authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to address this vulnerability. 
When a user logs in, a session is established and a unique session ID is assigned to the user. 
Subsequent requests are checked against this session ID to ensure that the user is authenticated. 
Additionally, the user's role is verified before allowing any updates to be made to other user roles. 
Only users with the role of admin are permitted to update user roles, and even they are subject to 
session-based authentication.

Input validations, audit logging, 2FA can be incorporated.
