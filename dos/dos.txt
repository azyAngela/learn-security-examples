- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The vulnerability lies in the lack of error handling for potential database errors when querying for user information.  
This lack of error handling can potentially lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack if an attacker repeatedly sends 
requests with malformed or invalid IDs, causing the server to become unresponsive or crash. In the secure version, 
error handling mechanisms are implemented to address this vulnerability. 

Rate limiting, input validations, monitering and alerting could be incorporated to prevent such attacks.
