Ans:
 Vulnerability refers to a weakness in the design, implementation, or configuration of a 
 software system that could be exploited by attackers to compromise the confidentiality, 
 integrity, or availability of the system or its data. Vulnerabilities can arise from various 
 sources, including programming errors, misconfigurations, design flaws, or improper handling of user input.

 CIA principle violated is the integrity. The program didn't ensure that data remains unchanged.
